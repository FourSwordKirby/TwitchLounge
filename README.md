# Setup
I'm still exploring which version of Node to use. So far these seem to be ok:

Node: v5.0.0
(You can use NVM if you want or just install that version)

After installing, install NPM (Node package manager).

Then, to install the modules, run the following:
npm install

I would also recommend the following b/c they make development easier:
* npm install -g node-inspector (then you can run node-debug server.js and use a browser for debugging. Use 'debugger')
* npm install -g nodemon (small changes on server code will automatically restart server)

Finally, ask me for the keys.json file.
It should run.
